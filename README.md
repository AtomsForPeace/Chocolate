# Chocolate
Chocolate is an Open Source media manager.<br>
It allows you to manage your media collection and organize it in a way that is easy to use and easy to search.<br>
It's a free software.<br>


# How to use ?
Actually there's no installer, you have to do everything manually, I will do an update in the future.
- Install all the library -> pip install -r requirements.txt
- Install ffmpeg and put it in your path -> [tuto](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10)
- Start app.py
- Go the the settings and add your movies path
- Restart the app.py
And enjoy
